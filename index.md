Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being hailed as a new breeding ground for immense innovation potential. While scholars believe that NLP has enormous potential for excessive growth, one question remains: how can it be used for the better welfare of the society? Researchers believe that NLP-based technologies could help to solve societal issues such as equality and inclusion, education, health, and hunger, and climate action etc. and many more. The field is focused on delivering positive social impact in accordance with the priorities outlined in the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Tackling these questions requires a concerted, collaborative effort across all sectors of society. The Symposium on NLP for Social Good is a novel effort that aims to enable NLP researchers and scholars from interdisciplinary field who want to think about the societal implications of their work for solving humanitarian and environmental challenges. The symposium aims to support fundamental research and engineering efforts and empower the social sector with tools and resources, while collaborating with partners from all sectors to maximise effect in solving problems within public health, nature & society, climate & energy, accessibility, crisis response etc.
